## Description 
  In this project I was had to take a fully functional google book API that was originally designed for a RESTFUl API, and change it to run with GraphQL and Apollo.

## Installation
  For installation you have the choice to clone this repo or use the [live link](https://nw-book-machine.herokuapp.com/). If you choose to clone this repo then you will need to open this up in the file editor of your liking. Then open the terminal and type this into the command line `npm i`. Once you do that it will download all of the necessary packages, once that is complete you will need to run the command `npm run develop`, once you have done this it will automatically open up a new tab and you can now use the book search machine.
